# engageclients

This repository includes the answers to the two tasks of the data scientist challenge.  
It is designed in a way that one can classify if a user would be loyal or not. There are two models to suggest new pages and products to users.

The new Tensorflew Recommendation API has been utilized to develop the recommender system.

# A. Exercise #1

#### Based on the information provided, What are some of the biggest drivers of retention and engagement? Why?

1. Desktop applications have much better retention rates
2. Linux OS has similar users compared to IOS and Android, but with higher retention
Therefore I conclude that users with personal computers have better interaction with the product
